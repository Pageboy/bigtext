Big lorries need big type. That's true but another thing that is also true is that companies use their own distribution transport to advertise themselves and a recent trend is to come up with a catchy slogan that goes beyond just the name of the company.

When it comes to making full use of the space, look no further than FedEx (notice the camelcase too).

The FedEX logo used a bold form of the Futura typeface although there is a bit of manipulation of the spacing to achieve the arrow formed between the E and x. I have highlighted this in the image below.

## Big Lorries provide a Lot of Space

Think of it as a moving billboard. The lorries we see on our motorways are often huge. We don't want those bog polluting vehicles coming into our cities and so, the distribution centres are usually somewhere out on the ring road. But a big lorry canvas is a space for the large scale typography to reach you as it flashed by at 60mph.

## Less is More

On the one hand, you might want to fill the space and make the message easy to read at high speeds, but then if the lorry is smaller (like for making local deliveries), then you can afford to have a bit of detailed information, such as in this ESSELUNGA vehicle seen in Florence, Italy.
